# Flask Learning

In the quickstart [directory](quickstart) can be found the quickstart site. This was made using pipenv; check out the [virtualizing instructions](howToVirtualize.md) to learn how to run the website.

Loaded this flask app onto a [docker container here](docker_jmussman).

Also, [my notes](Notes.md).
