# Flask Learning

In the [quickstart directory](quickstart) can be found the quickstart site. This was made using pipenv; check out the [virtualizing instructions](howToVirtualize.md) to learn how to run the website.

Here, a [Flask app was done via Docker](docker_jmussman).

Also, [**Basic** Docker Notes](Notes.md).

Then, there is a [setup.py](setup.py) for [learning how to properly package an app](mypackage).
