# Flask Learning

In the [quickstart directory](quickstart) can be found the quickstart site. This was made using pipenv; check out the [virtualizing instructions](howToVirtualize.md) to learn how to run the website.

Another flask app was done via Docker; see [docker container proj here](docker_jmussman).

Also, [my notes](Notes.md).
